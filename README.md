My name is Robert Bayer!

I am a graduating senior at The Georgia Institute of Technology where I am majoring in Computer Engineer with concentrations in Cybersecurity, Computing Hardware, and Emerging Architectures.
During my time at Tech, I have found an affinity for Embedded System design and programming as well as FPGA system design and integration.  Additionally, I have found a passion for reverse engineering
both hardware and software, particulalry malware.  I have experience in PCB design, Intel PIN and HexRays IDAPro.  I program primarily in C with a close second in Python.

I always look to take on a wide array of projects and I am only satisfied when design requirements and desires are met. No short cuts taken. Let's be creative and make some cool stuff!
